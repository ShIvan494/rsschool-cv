## ABOUT MYSELF:


 I am a lawyer by education. I graduated from the Faculty of Law of the Belarusian State University. After graduating and to the present, I work in the field of bad debt recovery in financial companies and banks.
 
 
 A year ago, I became interested in the field of IT. I decided to start my acquaintance with my future profession by taking a course on the basics of computer science. In the process of training, I received information about various areas in the field of information technology. I focused on web development.
 
 
 I am interested in web development because this profession provides endless opportunities for professional growth,in addition, there are a huge number of free quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.
 
 
 I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an experienced Frontend Developer.
